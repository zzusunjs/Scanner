# Scanner
A simple Scanner for Compiler
  This is also the code of the Complie-Theory class. And that code doesn't very strong for all kinds of input. For example, if you hava a string
 like 5ss, the sacnner may take the string apart and thinks it is a number 5 and a identifier ss. However, it is actually a mistake.
   Besides, I make the prepoecess a independent possess and thus I have to scann the string twice.
   This code may be too straight but it is a good start!
   
   Good night!
